# Functional Specifications - Baseball Monte Carlo Simulation Project

## Project Title
**Monte Carlo Simulation of Baseball Season Outcomes**

## Purpose
This project aims to simulate the outcomes of a baseball season using Monte Carlo methods, based on real-world data such as player statistics, team rosters, and schedules. The goal is to provide a data-driven forecast of team performances, win/loss records, and probability distributions of final standings.

## User Stories

###  As a coach:
"I want to estimate the likelihood of my team reaching the playoffs so I can make better strategic decisions."

###  As a data analyst:
"I want to simulate thousands of possible seasons so I can understand the variance and expected outcomes."

###  As a developer:
"I want to modularize the code so I can update player stats and rerun simulations easily in the future."

## Functional Requirements

### 1. **Simulation Engine**
- The system must simulate the outcome of a single game between two teams.
- The simulation must use player statistics (e.g., batting average, ERA) to probabilistically determine outcomes.
- The system must simulate a full season (e.g., 162 games per team).

### 2. **Data Handling**
- Load and preprocess player and team data from CSV or other structured sources.
- Handle missing data gracefully and log any assumptions or replacements.

### 3. **Repeatability & Reproducibility**
- Simulations must be repeatable using a fixed random seed.
- Results must be reproducible on any machine with the same data and code.

### 4. **Output Requirements**
- Provide summary statistics (e.g., average wins/losses per team, confidence intervals).
- Export results to CSV or visualization-ready formats.
- Generate visual summaries (e.g., win distribution histograms).

---

## Acceptance Criteria

-  Can simulate at least 1000 seasons within a reasonable time frame (< 5 minutes).
-  Simulation results show realistic variance and match expected win/loss distribution trends.
-  Results are saved in a structured format in the `results/` folder.
-  AI assistance (if used) is documented in the `Status_Log` and `Activity_List`.
-  Project folder follows required structure and includes all management artifacts.

## Constraints

- All simulations must rely only on publicly available data from [Baseball-Reference.com](https://www.baseball-reference.com/).
- The code should be executable in a standard Python environment (e.g., Python 3.8+, pandas, NumPy).
- Optional: Visualizations can be generated using matplotlib or seaborn.

---

## Dependencies

- Python 3.8+
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib / seaborn (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook (for running and displaying results, optional)

---

## Future Enhancements

- Add player injuries and fatigue to affect simulation accuracy.
- Include head-to-head matchup advantages.
- Add real-time update support for in-season predictions.
