# Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) - Monte Carlo Baseball Simulation

## Level 1: Baseball Simulation Project

---

### 1. Data Collection & Preprocessing
#### 1.1. Collect player, roster, and schedule data from Baseball-Reference.com  
#### 1.2. Clean and preprocess raw datasets  
#### 1.3. Handle missing or inconsistent data  
#### 1.4. Save cleaned datasets to `prepared_data/`  

---

### 2. Core Simulation Code
#### 2.1. Write code to simulate a single game based on team and player stats  
#### 2.2. Implement logic to simulate full season schedules  
#### 2.3. Add support for running multiple simulations (e.g., 1000 seasons)  
#### 2.4. Enable seeding for reproducibility  
#### 2.5. Save simulation scripts to `functional_code/`  

---

### 3. Result Analysis & Visualization
#### 3.1. Aggregate results across simulations (e.g., team win distributions)  
#### 3.2. Generate CSV files with summary statistics  
#### 3.3. Create visualizations (e.g., bar plots, histograms)  
#### 3.4. Save all outputs to `results/`  

---

### 4. Project Documentation
#### 4.1. Write Functional Specs (user stories, requirements, acceptance criteria)  
#### 4.2. Create WBS (this document)  
#### 4.3. Maintain Product Backlog (features, bugs, tasks)  
#### 4.4. Maintain Status Log (daily progress tracking)  
#### 4.5. Maintain Activity List (timestamped logs)  
#### 4.6. Define Project Roadmap (milestones & timeline)  
#### 4.7. Store all documentation in `documentation_and_project_management_artifacts/`  

---

### 5. Supplementary Code
#### 5.1. Write raw data loading scripts  
#### 5.2. Write scripts to transform raw data to structured format  
#### 5.3. Save preprocessing code in `supplementary_code/raw_data_processing/`  

---

### 6. GitHub Repository Setup
#### 6.1. Initialize and organize GitHub repository structure  
#### 6.2. Upload all required folders and files  
#### 6.3. Add README.md with project overview and usage instructions  
#### 6.4. Post GitHub link to Canvas discussion  

---

### 7. AI Collaboration Documentation
#### 7.1. Record how AI (e.g., ChatGPT) was used during the project  
#### 7.2. Note which files or tasks were AI-assisted  
#### 7.3. Reflect on the collaboration in the discussion post
